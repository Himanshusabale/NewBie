# NewBie

Welcome to **NewBie**! This project represents my creative journey as a developer. It is designed to showcase simple yet effective implementations of modern web design concepts.

Aim is to provide a centralized platform that offers easy access to study materials, information on nearby mess facilities, and details about hostel accommodations, 
simplifying the student experience and improving academic performance.
